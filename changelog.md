# 0.2.0

* Renamed `createFactory` to `types.model` (breaking!)
* Renamed `composeFactory` to `types.extend` (breaking!)
* Models are no longer constructed by invoking the factory as function, but by calling `factory.create` (breaking!)
* Introduced `identifier`
* Introduced / improved `reference`
* Greatly improved typescript support, type inference etc. However there are still limitations as the full typesystem of MST cannot be expressed in TypeScript. Especially concerning the type of snapshots and the possibility to use snapshots as first class value.
